## <u>Living Organisms</u>

#### <u>Cells</u>
![[animalPlantCell.jpg]]


#### <u>Plants</u>

**Photosynthesis** => carbon dioxide + water + sunlight  => glucose + oxygen

#### Roots and Leaves Relation
1. **Fibrous Root** => Parallel Ventilation
2. **Tap Root** => Reticulate Ventilation!

#### Flower Parts
 ![[flowerParts.png]]

#### Part Of Seeds
![[partOfSeed.jpg]]

**Cytology** : study of cell
**histology** : study of tissue

**Autotrophs** : Organisms that make there own food
**Herotrophs** : Organisms that rely on others for food

**Nitrogen Cycle** -> nitrogen > nitrification bacteria (take atmosphere nitrogen , decompose organic material ) > Nitrates > absorbed by plant and remaining is released in atmosphere.

**Parasites** : organism that take nutrition from another organism , depriving of all there nutrition in the process.
**Saprotrophs** : Organism that rely on dead and decaying matter for food.
**Insectivorous Plant** : Plants that feed on insects (grow in nitrogen deficient soil , so they use insect for nitrogen)

#### <u>Transportation in Plants</u>

**Osmosis** : movement of solvent from lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration through a semi permeable membrane.
**Phloem** : Transport material from leaves to root.
**Xylem** : Transport material from root to leaves
**Transpiration** : loss of water from stomata 

#### <u>Sexual Reproduction In Plants</u>

**Ovary develops into fruit** 
**Ovules develops into seed**

#### <u>Animals</u>

![[digestiveSystem.jpg]]

**Saliva converts starch to maltose, and the enzyme maltase converts maltose to glucose**

**Tooth Decay** : If mouth becomes acidic and because of bacteria deposit.
**Splinter Valve** : Present at the end of esophagus and end of stomach it prevents food from going back in esophagus from stomach and food from going back from small intestine to stomach.

**Stomach** : HCL digest food in 4 hr.
**Small intestine absorbs food and large intestine absorbs water and remove waste material**

**Bile juice digests fats**
**Pancreatic juice contains enzymes that digest proteins, fats, and carbohydrates**

**Grass-eating animals, like cows, digest food in multiple stomachs. They first swallow grass into the rumen, where microbes break down cellulose (the tough plant fiber) into simpler compounds. The food is then regurgitated as "cud" for further chewing. The intestines, which can be quite long (up to 100 feet in some animals), help absorb the remaining nutrients before waste is excreted. The length of the intestines aids in maximizing nutrient absorption.**

**In an amoeba, digestion occurs through a process called phagocytosis. The amoeba surrounds and engulfs its food, usually a small organism or particle, with its cell membrane, forming a food vacuole. Inside the vacuole, digestive enzymes break down the food into smaller molecules. These nutrients are then absorbed into the amoeba's cytoplasm for energy. Any undigested material is expelled from the cell by a process called exocytosis.**

**Diffusion is the process in which gas moves from higher concentration to lower concentration**
**Every Cell of our body needs oxygen to burn food and release energy in form of ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)**

**Aerobic Respiration** : Need of Oxygen
**Anaerobic Respiration** : Without the need of oxygen

#### <u>Heart</u>

**Arteries** : Pure Blood (exception  pulmonary arterie)
**Veins** : Impure Blood (exception pulmonary vein)

**Blood is fluid tissue , it contain Plasma, White Blood Cells, Red Blood Cell (haemo -> iron , globin -> protein), platelets**

#### <u>Acid and Base</u>

**Acid** : Sour taste, less than 7 pH , H+ ions
**Basic** : Bitter taste, more than 7 pH , OH- ions

**Acid + Base => Neutralisation**
**Metallic Oxide are basic in nature**

## <u>Magnets</u>

#### Magnetic Lines 
1. **Inside magnet** : south to north
2. **Outside magnet** : north to south

**Earth real north is earth magnetic south pole and earth real south is earth magnetic north pole**

## Electric Current

**Flow of electron from positive terminal to negative terminal is electric current (ampere / sec or coulomb )**
$1 C = 6.242 \times 10^{18} e$
$1e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} c$

**Heating Effect of Current :**  $H = I^{2}RT$  (**It depends on -** thickness , material and length of wire)

**Concave mirror form a real, magnified and inverted image. when the object is close to mirror the image is erect and virtual.**
**Convex mirror form erect and virtual image that are smaller than the object**

**Convex lenses form real, virtual and diminished image and when object is really close to it, it forms erect, virtual and magnified image**
**Concave lenses form virtual, erect and diminished image.**
